**Red Velvet Cake**

like any other cake recipe, even red velvet cake is prepared with combination of all purpose flour, cocoa powder, condensed milk, butter and milk. however it also contains buttermilk or vinegar which makes it unique and yields a soft and moist cake due to the gas-producing reaction of acidic substance.

**Notes**

* firstly, frost the cake only after its cooled completely, else the frosting will melt.
* furthermore, use oil instead of butter if you are preserving the cake and eating later. as butter hardens once refrigerated whereas oil doesnâ€™t and keeps cake more moist.
* also to bake in microwave convection mode pre heat and bake at 180 degrees for 40 minutes. and to bake in cooker check out how to bake in cooker.
* finally, eggless red velvet cake recipe is traditionally prepared with cream cheese frosting, however you can replace with vanilla frosting used for black forest cake recipe.
